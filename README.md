# Motion Capture Interpolation

This project is programmed in C++, run on Windows,Mac and Linux with C++ compiler.\
Before executing the code, you can check the details of this project in http://barbic.usc.edu/cs520-s21/assign2/
```
for OSX and Linux:
    To run mocaplayer(create a window to show the motions):
    run $./mocaplayer in the command line
    
    To run interpolators:
    run $./interpolate [skeleton file name].asf [motion file name].amc [l/b] [e/q] [N for keyframe interval] [outfilename].amc
    
    For example 
    To interpolate 131_04-dance.amc in bezier SLERP quaternion interpolation with a keyframe interval of 20 and out put to a file called dance_bq.amcï¼š
    
    $./interpolate 131_dance.asf 131_04-dance.amc b q 20 dance_bq.amc
```
### What have I done

This project's main object is to interpolate the given motion with different interpolate strategies--Linear interpolation for Euler angle, Bezier interpolation for Euler angles, SLERP interpolation for quaternions and Bezier interpolation for SLERP quaternions.
The linear interpolation for Euler angles are already given, so we need to implement the other 3 interpolations and compare the speed and accuracy of the 4 interpolation schemes.

### Input Files
The inputs are skeleton files and motion files. 
The skeleton file (ASF) describes how the bones in the skeleton are connected, and their degrees of freedom (see Figure 1 for a representative skeleton). All bones are described in the ":bonedata" section of this file. Each bone has the following fields:
```
begin
id bone_id                  //Unique id for each bone
name bone_name        //Unique name for each bone
direction dX dY dZ    //Vector describing direction of the bone in world coordinate system
length 7.01722           //Length of the bone
axis 0 0 20 XYZ         //Rotation of local coordinate system for
                                   //this bone relative to the world coordinate
                                   //system. In AMC file the rotation angles
                                    //for this bone for each time frame will be
                                   //defined relative to this local coordinate
                                    //system (see Figure 2)
dof rx ry rz                //Degrees of freedom for this bone.
limits (-160.0 20.0)
            (-70.0 70.0)
            (-60.0 70.0)
end
```
The parent/child relationship among all bones in skeleton hierarchy is defined in the ":hierarchy " section of the ASF file. Each line list the parent first, then its children.

For example:
"root lhipjoint rhipjoint lowerback"

Root is a parent and lhipjoint, rhipjoint, lowerback are root's children.

**The motion file (AMC)** gives each bone's rotation angles (in Euler angles) relative to the bone's reference local coordinate system. The bone's reference local coordinate system is defined in the skeleton (ASF) file. One entry is given for each frame, at a frame rate of 120 fps.

**Displaying the animation**

First load the skeleton (ASF) file. Then load the motion (AMC) file. Press play button to view the motion.
